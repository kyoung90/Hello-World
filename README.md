Hi,

My name is Kenneth R. Young Castro. I'm currently studying computer engineering in Universidad del Turabo. I love hearthstone and consider myself above average in the things that I like. I wish to learn more about programming so I can expand my toolbox and be able to make my plans come to fruition. My plans involve helping other people through video games, making things fun and simple, and educating the world.
